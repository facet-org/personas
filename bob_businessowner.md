| Thinks | Bob thinks that the national and local economies are booming and that local business ownership is crucial to a vibrant community. He also thinks that raising taxes hurts everyone, and that immigration has caused wage gouging in his home state of Texas. He thinks that democrats want to take from him and give to others who are not deserving of his hard-earned money. |
| Sees   | Bob sees an increasingly divided America, with tumultuous politics that threaten his liberties. He sees the nationwide protests over racial injustice that has devolved into riots, and a pandemic that has left his livelihood injured. |
| Feels  | Bob feels angry that politicians have not represented his interests, angry that people are so energized for change but putting their energy in the wrong places, and worried that a Joe Biden presidency will spell bad things for his livelihood. Bob feels disenfranchised about politics, that he doesn't have the power to effect the change he would like to see. |
| Does   | Bob is very vocal on social media, and voices his frustrations frequently and openly. Bob votes during the presidential & congressional elections, and occasionally in the midterm elections. He is not active in local politics. |
